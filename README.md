# Remote Covid Tracker (Java)

This is a COVID Tracker Simulation where a certain amount of people enter a specific area with x and y meters and a certain % of them have COVID. During walklife time, people move around this space using the random way mobility and when they are within the unsafe distance for a specific amount of time, they become potential carriers and turn into orange. 

The results are logged in a file called tracer.log, and are sent to another IP address (for demo purposes, localhost is used).
